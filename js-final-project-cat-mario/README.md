## JS final project
### CAT MARIO

This project is a fun 2d-platform mario-like game but the levels are weird. 
The objects and enemies behave differently than expected, which provides hilarious as well as frustating experience.
Its levels designed to cause frustration due to innocuous-looking objects that suddenly kill the character.

This project also consists of its own level-maker as well. You can design your own level and play it as well.
