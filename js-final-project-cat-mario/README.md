### Description

<strong>Cat Mario</strong> is a fun 2d-platform mario-like game but the levels are weird. The objects and enemies behave differently than expected, which provides hilarious as well as frustating experience. Its levels designed to cause frustration due to innocuous-looking objects that suddenly kill the character. It is riddled with traps designed to trick the player, and abuse their previous knowledge of Super Mario Bros. gameplay, including normal-looking ground tiles that fall away into pits, blocks that sprout spikes when touched, enemies that spawn nearly on top of the character, deadly background scenery, coin blocks rigged at the edge of a pit to cause the character to fall down, and a Mario-style flagpole that kills the character. Despite the surprise factor of these traps, the levels do not change between plays, allowing the player to memorize their locations and patterns and eventually make progress.
